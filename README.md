# Dragonfly

## Overview 

Project Dragonfly serves as a way to consolidate several low-profile sensors into a single, peripheral device, which attaches via USB to an drone in order to provide an estimation of state while keeping the device as small as possible. In doing so, we hope to create a modular, more cost effective way of providing state estimation, reducing the individual sensor configuration workload for drone manufacturers and hobbyists
